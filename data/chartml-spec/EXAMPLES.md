## Reusable Styles and Configuration

This section demonstrates how to define reusable themes and apply them across multiple charts.

### Define a Reusable Style

```chartml
type: style
version: 1
name: corporate_theme
colors: ["#4285f4", "#ea4335", "#fbbc04", "#34a853"]
grid:
  y: true
  color: "#e0e0e0"
  opacity: 0.5
height: 400
fonts:
  title:
    family: "Inter, sans-serif"
    size: 18
    weight: 600
```

### Set Dashboard-Level Default Style

All charts below will inherit `corporate_theme` automatically:

```chartml
type: config
version: 1
style: corporate_theme
```

### Charts Automatically Inherit the Theme

**Chart 1: Revenue Trend** - Uses all defaults from corporate_theme

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Monthly Revenue"

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - month: "Jan"
      revenue: 125000
    - month: "Feb"
      revenue: 138000
    - month: "Mar"
      revenue: 152000

visualize:
  type: bar
  columns: month
  rows: revenue
```

**Chart 2: Customer Growth** - Also inherits theme, demonstrates multiple charts sharing style

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "New Customers"

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - month: "Jan"
      customers: 450
    - month: "Feb"
      customers: 485
    - month: "Mar"
      customers: 520

visualize:
  type: line
  columns: month
  rows: customers
```

### Chart with Selective Overrides (Deep Merge)

This chart overrides just height and grid color while keeping corporate_theme's fonts and base colors:

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Regional Breakdown"

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - region: "US"
      revenue: 85000
    - region: "EU"
      revenue: 67000

visualize:
  type: pie
  columns: region
  rows: revenue
  style:
    height: 300
    grid:
      color: "#ff0000"
```

### Config with Inline Style

For one-off dashboard themes without creating a named style, you can define inline styles:

```yaml
type: config
version: 1
style:
  colors: ["#1a237e", "#3949ab", "#5e92f3"]
  height: 500
  grid:
    y: true
    color: "#f0f0f0"
```

*(Note: Example shown as YAML instead of chartml to avoid multiple configs in this file)*

## KPI Overview: Executive Metrics Dashboard

This dashboard demonstrates metric cards (KPI cards) that display key performance indicators with trend comparisons.

### Key Performance Metrics

A row of 4 metric cards showing critical business metrics with month-over-month comparisons:

```chartml
- type: chart
  version: 1
  title: "Total Revenue"
  layout:
    colSpan: 3

  data:
    provider: inline
    rows:
        - { current: 1234567, previous: 1100000 }

  visualize:
    type: metric
    value: current
    format: "$,.0f"
    compareWith: previous

- type: chart
  version: 1
  title: "Active Users"
  layout:
    colSpan: 3

  data:
    provider: inline
    rows:
        - { current: 8432, previous: 8100 }

  visualize:
    type: metric
    value: current
    format: ",.0f"
    compareWith: previous

- type: chart
  version: 1
  title: "Conversion Rate"
  layout:
    colSpan: 3

  data:
    provider: inline
    rows:
        - { current: 0.042, previous: 0.038 }

  visualize:
    type: metric
    value: current
    format: ".1%"
    compareWith: previous

- type: chart
  version: 1
  title: "Avg Order Value"
  layout:
    colSpan: 3

  data:
    provider: inline
    rows:
        - { current: 156.78, previous: 142.50 }

  visualize:
    type: metric
    value: current
    format: "$,.2f"
    compareWith: previous
```

### Error Rate Metric (Inverted Trend)

This metric shows error rate where a decrease is positive (green) and an increase is negative (red).

**Metric Label Rules:**

Metric cards support two optional label locations:
- **`chart.title`** → Label shown **above** the card (like all chart types)
- **`visualize.label`** → Label shown **inside** the card (metric-specific feature)
- If neither specified → Only the formatted value is shown

**Examples:**

```chartml
# Just the number (no labels)
type: chart
version: 1
data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - revenue: 45000
visualize:
  type: metric
  value: revenue
  format: "$,.0f"
```

```chartml
# Label inside card only
type: chart
version: 1
data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - revenue: 45000
visualize:
  type: metric
  value: revenue
  label: "Total Revenue"   # Shows inside card
  format: "$,.0f"
```

```chartml
# Title above + label inside
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Q1 Performance"    # Shows above card
data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - revenue: 45000
visualize:
  type: metric
  value: revenue
  label: "Revenue"         # Shows inside card
  format: "$,.0f"
```

**Error Rate Example (inverted trend):**

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
      - { current: 0.023, previous: 0.031 }

visualize:
  type: metric
  value: current
  label: "Error Rate"      # Shows "Error Rate" inside the metric card
  format: ".2%"
  compareWith: previous
  invertTrend: true        # Red for up, green for down
```

## Dashboard 7: Time Series Forecasting

Forecasting extends the `transform:` pipeline with a `forecast` stage. It can be used standalone on pre-aggregated data or chained after an `aggregate` stage.

### Revenue Forecast (Declarative)

Standalone forecast on inline time series data. The `forecast` stage appends predicted rows with `forecast`, `upper_bound`, and `lower_bound` columns.

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Revenue Forecast"

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - date: "2025-01"
      revenue: 125000
    - date: "2025-02"
      revenue: 138000
    - date: "2025-03"
      revenue: 152000
    - date: "2025-04"
      revenue: 148000
    - date: "2025-05"
      revenue: 165000
    - date: "2025-06"
      revenue: 172000

transform:
  forecast:
    timestamp: date
    value: revenue
    horizon: 3
    confidence_level: 0.95
    model: auto

visualize:
  type: line
  columns: date
  rows:
    - field: revenue
      label: "Actual Revenue"
    - field: forecast
      mark: line
      lineStyle: dashed
      label: "Forecast"
    - mark: range
      upper: upper_bound
      lower: lower_bound
      label: "95% Confidence"
      opacity: 0.15
  axes:
    rows:
      label: "Revenue ($)"
      format: "$,.0f"
  style:
    height: 400
```

### Aggregation with Forecast

Chaining `aggregate` into `forecast` — the aggregate stage rolls daily transactions into monthly totals, then forecast projects forward.

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Monthly Revenue with Forecast"

data:
  sales:
    datasource: "production-postgres"
    query: |
      SELECT sale_date, revenue
      FROM sales.transactions
      WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'

transform:
  aggregate:
    dimensions:
      - column: sale_date
        name: month
        type: month
    measures:
      - column: revenue
        aggregation: sum
        name: revenue
  forecast:
    timestamp: month
    value: revenue
    horizon: 6
    model: auto

visualize:
  type: line
  columns: month
  rows:
    - field: revenue
      label: "Actual Revenue"
    - field: forecast
      mark: line
      lineStyle: dashed
      label: "Forecast"
    - mark: range
      upper: upper_bound
      lower: lower_bound
      label: "95% Confidence"
      opacity: 0.15
  axes:
    rows:
      label: "Revenue ($)"
      format: "$,.0f"
```

## Interactive Dashboard Parameters

This example demonstrates the dashboard parameters pattern for creating interactive dashboards where parameter controls update all charts dynamically.

### How It Works

**1. Define Named Params Block** - Creates shared interactive UI controls:
```chartml
type: params
version: 1
name: dashboard_filters          # Required - unique block name
params:
  - id: region
    type: multiselect
    label: "Region"
    options: ["US", "EU", "APAC", "LATAM"]
    default: ["US", "EU"]

  - id: date_range
    type: daterange
    label: "Date Range"
    default:
      start: "2024-01-01"
      end: "2024-12-31"

  - id: min_revenue
    type: number
    label: "Minimum Revenue ($)"
    default: 1000
```

**2. Reference Parameters in Charts** - Use `$blockname.param_id` variable syntax:
```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Regional Sales"

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
      - region: "US"
        month: "2024-01"
        revenue: 15000
      - region: "EU"
        month: "2024-01"
        revenue: 12000
      - region: "APAC"
        month: "2024-01"
        revenue: 8000

transform:
  aggregate:
    filters:
      combinator: and
      rules:
        - field: region
          operator: in
          value: "$dashboard_filters.region"       # ← References named param

        - field: revenue
          operator: ">="
          value: "$dashboard_filters.min_revenue"  # ← References named param

visualize:
  type: bar
  columns: region
  rows: revenue
  style:
    height: 400
```

### Complete Dashboard Example

**Named params block (shared across all charts):**

```chartml
type: params
version: 1
name: dashboard_filters
params:
  - id: region
    type: multiselect
    label: "Region"
    options: ["US", "EU", "APAC"]
    default: ["US", "EU"]

  - id: min_revenue
    type: number
    label: "Minimum Revenue ($)"
    default: 5000
```

**Chart using named params:**

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Quarterly Revenue by Region"

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
      - region: "US"
        q1: 125000
        q2: 138000
        customers: 1200
      - region: "EU"
        q1: 98000
        q2: 112000
        customers: 980
      - region: "APAC"
        q1: 75000
        q2: 88000
        customers: 750

transform:
  aggregate:
    dimensions: [region]
    measures:
      - column: q1
        aggregation: sum
        name: q1_revenue
      - column: q2
        aggregation: sum
        name: q2_revenue
      - expression: "q1_revenue + q2_revenue"
        name: total_revenue

    filters:
      combinator: and
      rules:
        - field: region
          operator: in
          value: "$dashboard_filters.region"      # Named param reference

        - field: total_revenue
          operator: ">="
          value: "$dashboard_filters.min_revenue" # Named param reference

visualize:
  type: bar
  mode: grouped
  columns: region
  rows:
    - field: q1_revenue
      label: "Q1"
    - field: q2_revenue
      label: "Q2"
  axes:
    rows:
      label: "Revenue ($)"
      format: "$,.0f"
  style:
    height: 400
```

**Chart with Chart-Level Inline Params:**

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Top Products"

params:  # Chart-level params (no name field)
  - id: top_n
    type: number
    label: "Top N"
    default: 10

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - product: "Widget A"
      revenue: 50000
    - product: "Widget B"
      revenue: 45000
    - product: "Widget C"
      revenue: 38000

transform:
  aggregate:
    dimensions: [product]
    measures:
      - column: revenue
        aggregation: sum
        name: total_revenue
    sort:
      - field: total_revenue
        direction: desc
    limit: "$top_n"  # Chart-level param (no prefix)

visualize:
  type: bar
  columns: product
  rows: total_revenue
  style:
    height: 400
```

### Parameter Types

**Available parameter types:**

1. **multiselect** - Checkbox group for multiple selections
   ```yaml
   - id: regions
     type: multiselect
     label: "Regions"
     options: ["US", "EU", "APAC"]
     default: ["US"]
   ```

2. **select** - Dropdown for single selection
   ```yaml
   - id: category
     type: select
     label: "Category"
     options: ["All", "Electronics", "Clothing"]
     default: "All"
   ```

3. **daterange** - Start and end date inputs
   ```yaml
   - id: period
     type: daterange
     label: "Date Range"
     default:
       start: "2024-01-01"
       end: "2024-12-31"
   ```

4. **number** - Numeric input
   ```yaml
   - id: threshold
     type: number
     label: "Min Revenue"
     default: 1000
   ```

5. **text** - Text search input
   ```yaml
   - id: search
     type: text
     label: "Search Products"
     placeholder: "Enter product name..."
     default: ""
   ```

### Variable Resolution

**Nested parameter values** are accessed using dot notation:
```yaml
transform:
  aggregate:
    filters:
      rules:
        - field: date
          operator: between
          value: ["$params.date_range.start", "$params.date_range.end"]
```

**Resolution happens before pipeline execution:**
- `"$params.region"` → `["US", "EU"]` (from parameter state)
- `"$params.min_revenue"` → `5000` (from parameter state)
- ChartML pipeline receives resolved values and executes normally

### Chart-Level vs Dashboard-Level Parameters

**Dashboard-Level** (standalone params block):
```chartml
type: params
version: 1
name: global_filters  # Required - unique block name
params:
  - id: global_date_range
    type: daterange
    label: "Date Range"
    default:
      start: "2024-01-01"
      end: "2024-12-31"
```

**Chart-Level** (inline in chart):
```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Revenue by Region"

params:  # Chart-specific parameters
  - id: selected_regions
    type: multiselect
    label: "Regions"
    options: ["US", "EU", "APAC"]
    default: ["US"]

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
    - region: "US"
      revenue: 25000
    - region: "EU"
      revenue: 18000
    - region: "APAC"
      revenue: 12000

visualize:
  type: bar
  columns: region
  rows: revenue
```

**Variable Syntax:**
- Dashboard-level params: `$blockname.param_id` (e.g., `$global_filters.global_date_range`)
- Chart-level params: `$param_id` (e.g., `$selected_regions`)

**Resolution:**
- Has dot → named param from registry (e.g., `$global_filters.global_date_range`)
- No dot → chart-level param from inline `params:` section (e.g., `$selected_regions`)

### Complete Chart-Level Params Example

This example shows a chart with its own inline parameters that render above the chart:

```chartml
type: chart
version: 1
title: "Regional Revenue Analysis"

params:
  - id: selected_regions
    type: multiselect
    label: "Regions"
    options: ["US", "EU", "APAC", "LATAM"]
    default: ["US", "EU"]
    layout:
      colSpan: 6

  - id: min_revenue
    type: number
    label: "Minimum Revenue ($)"
    default: 10000
    layout:
      colSpan: 6

data:
  provider: inline
  rows:
      - region: "US"
        product: "Widget A"
        revenue: 25000
      - region: "EU"
        product: "Widget A"
        revenue: 18000
      - region: "APAC"
        product: "Widget A"
        revenue: 12000
      - region: "LATAM"
        product: "Widget A"
        revenue: 8000
      - region: "US"
        product: "Widget B"
        revenue: 30000
      - region: "EU"
        product: "Widget B"
        revenue: 22000

transform:
  aggregate:
    dimensions: [region]
    measures:
      - column: revenue
        aggregation: sum
        name: total_revenue

    filters:
      combinator: and
      rules:
        - field: region
          operator: in
          value: "$params.selected_regions"

        - field: total_revenue
          operator: ">="
          value: "$params.min_revenue"

visualize:
  type: bar
  columns: region
  rows: total_revenue
  axes:
    rows:
      label: "Revenue ($)"
      format: "$,.0f"
  style:
    height: 400
```

**How it renders:**
1. Parameter controls appear above the chart (responsive grid layout)
2. User changes "Regions" multiselect → chart filters to selected regions
3. User changes "Minimum Revenue" → chart filters to regions above threshold
4. Parameters only affect this specific chart (not other charts on the page)

**When to use chart-level params:**
- ✅ Chart-specific filtering (only applies to one chart)
- ✅ Self-contained charts that don't share parameters
- ✅ Rapid prototyping without creating dashboard-level params

**When to use dashboard-level params:**
- ✅ Multiple charts share the same parameters
- ✅ Global filtering across entire dashboard
- ✅ Cleaner markdown (params defined once at top)

### Key Features

- ✅ **Parameters defined once** - Used across all charts in the dashboard
- ✅ **Chart-level control** - Each chart chooses which parameters to use
- ✅ **URL-based sharing** - Parameter state stored in URL query params (bookmarkable)
- ✅ **No spec changes** - Uses existing `transform.filters` structure
- ✅ **Portable** - Parameter values can come from URL, React state, CLI, config files
- ✅ **Inline rendering** - Parameters render where defined in markdown

### Implementation Notes

**How parameter blocks work:**
1. `````chartml``` block with `type: params` parsed from markdown
2. Renders interactive DashboardParams component at block location
3. User changes parameter → updates parameter state → updates URL
4. Before chart execution: `$params.*` variables resolved to actual values
5. ChartML pipeline executes with resolved parameter values
6. Charts re-render with filtered data

**Benefits:**
- No ChartML spec changes required
- Parameters are just ChartML blocks with `type: params`
- Variable resolution is simple string replacement
- URL updates enable shareable filtered views
- Each chart independently chooses which parameters apply

## Summary

These mock dashboards demonstrate:

**Core Features:**
- **Reusable sources** - Define once, reference multiple times
- **Interactive parameters** - Dynamic dashboard filtering with URL-based sharing
- **All chart types** - Bar, line, area, scatter, pie, doughnut, table, metric
- **Chart modes** - Grouped bars, stacked bars, stacked areas, combo charts, dual y-axis
- **Transform pipeline** - `transform:` with nested `aggregate`, `sql`, and `forecast` stages
- **Data transformations** - Dimensions, measures, filters, calculations
- **Calculated fields** - Pre and post-aggregation calculations
- **Smart filtering** - WHERE vs HAVING auto-detection
- **Field references** - Chained calculated measures
- **Time series forecasting** - Declarative `forecast` stage with confidence intervals, standalone or chained after aggregate
- **Inline vs source** - Both patterns demonstrated
- **Markdown integration** - Narrative content with executable specs

**Phase 1 Customization Features:**
- **Number/Date Formatting** - Format axis labels and data labels (`$,.0f`, `.1%`, `~s`, date formats)
- **Axis Min/Max Control** - Override auto-scaling with custom bounds
- **Grid Line Customization** - Control visibility, color, opacity, dash patterns (x/y grids)
- **Data Labels on Marks** - Display values on bars, lines, and areas with positioning and formatting
